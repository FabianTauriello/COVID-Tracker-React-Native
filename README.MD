# The Brief:

React Native app for viewing statistical data relating to the COVID-19 disease. This is my first attempt at any cross-platform framework for building mobile apps. I attempted to re-write my other COVID-Tracker app built in Kotlin for Android, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FabianTauriello/COVID-Tracker).

## Description

COVID Tracker allows users to view statistical data relating to the COVID-19 disease. Data can be viewed for an individual country or worldwide. I used Expo CLI for building and testing. If you have the Expo app, you can test it out for yourself by clicking [here](https://expo.io/@fabiant/projects/COVIDTracker).

I used my iPhone SE (2020) and Sony Xperia X F5121 for testing.
